# Service Platform

Service platform is a full-blown application server built on top of OSGi platform.

It consists of multiple modules which are deployed as OSGi bundles and has everything you need to build a service oriented application: orchestration, administration, statistics, persistence and channel modules which enable communication via some of standard telecommunication protocols, such as SMS.

It was built in the light of 7 years of application server development from stracth in telecommunications sector and aims to address all the issues found in previous projects by building everything from scratch (which is the promise of all new software projects ;) ).

Contributions are welcome but keep in mind that the code was built as a prototype to be used in a new startup as a consultancy gig around 2015 and has never been touched ever since. Depending on the demand, the project can be revisited, renewed (using new features of Java8+ & modularity) and refactored.
